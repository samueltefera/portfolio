## Technologies Used

The Microservice Portfolio Project employs the following technologies:

- Node.js with Express for microservices implementation
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and deployment
- Redis for caching
- MongoDB for data storage
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Swagger for API documentation

## Microservices

The project consists of the following microservices, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
2. **User Service**: Manages user data and interactions.
3. **Product Service**: Handles product-related operations.
4. **Order Service**: Manages orders and order processing.
5. **Email Service**: Sends email notifications to users.
6. **Payment Service**: Manages payment processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Microservice Portfolio Project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Docker
- Kubernetes (minikube or any other Kubernetes cluster)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samueltefera/portfolio.git
```

2. Install the dependencies for each microservice.

pip install -r requirement.txt

cd ../user-service
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Repeat for other microservices...
```

3. Run each microservice locally for development.

```bash
cd src/*


cd ../user-service
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Repeat for other microservices...
```
